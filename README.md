# DNS Blocklists and RegEx entries

All collected entries with the help of the community for multiple purposes and tests, working for [PiHole](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/basic-install/) or [AdGuardHome](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/wiki/Getting-Started).

## sublert lists

Automatically generated list using [Sublert](https://github.com/yassineaboukir/sublert). This list contains all subdomains with TLS certificates and **cannot be used directly in pihole.** Sublert is a security and reconnaissance tool that was written in Python to leverage certificate transparency for the sole purpose of monitoring new subdomains deployed by specific organizations and issued TLS/SSL certificate.
